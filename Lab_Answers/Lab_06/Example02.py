"""
A class called Author (as shown in the class diagram) is designed to model a book's author. It contains:
Three private instance variables: name (String), email (String), and gender (char of either "m" or "f").
One constructor to initialize the name, email, and gender with the given values. There is no default constructor for Author, as there are no defaults for name, email, and gender.
public getters/setters: getName(), getEmail(), setEmail(), and getGender(). There are no setters for name and gender, as these attributes cannot be changed.
toString() method for string representation of the instance, in the text form: "Author[name=?,email=?,gender=?]".

A class called Book is designed (as shown in the class diagram) to model a book written by a single author. It contains:
Four private instance variables: name (String), author (of the class Author, you have just created, assume that a book has one and only one author), price (double), and qty (int) with a default value of 0.
Two constructors with qty and without qty.
A toString() that returns "Book[name=?,Author[name=?,email=?,gender=?],price=?,qty=?". You should reuse the Authorâ€™s toString().

Write Python code for the Author and Book class.
Note: You have to construct an instance of Author before you can construct an instance of Book.
